# Repository Guidelines

- Use Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and the stack outlined in `README.md` when adding Android code.
- Organise documentation under `docs/`.
- Keep commit messages descriptive and conventional.
- When creating new directories, ensure they align with the roadmap in the specification documents.
